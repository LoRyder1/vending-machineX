Why do Both **Acceptance Tests** and **Unit Tests**?

- Unit Tests belong to the programmer
- Acceptance Tests belong to the customer

Acceptance tests make the customer confident that the system does what he wants. Unit tests for a class make a developer who uses the class confident that the class does what she wants. The principle is as old as Simon and Garfunkel: "One man's ceiling is another man's floor"

This goes for black-box testing and white-box testing as well. Black-box testing is a method of software testing that examines the functionality of an application without peering into its internal structures or workings. White-box testing aka glass box testing is a method of testing software that tests internal structures or workings of an application, as opposed to its functionality. 

You do Acceptance Tests to make sure you give the customer what he needs. You do the Unit test to make sure you give the developers what they need. 

A combination of UnitTests and Acceptance Tests will yield a better overall benefit-to-cost ratio than Acceptance Tests alone.
